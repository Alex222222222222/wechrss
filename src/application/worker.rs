//! One-pass durable job execution.
//!
//! This module is the executable worker unit underneath future role-specific
//! runtime composition. [`Worker::run_once`] claims one allowed job, runs a
//! handler while heartbeating its lease, then applies the handler's typed
//! outcome through a caller-owned transaction and commits that transaction
//! exactly once. [`Worker::run_until_shutdown`] repeats that pass with bounded
//! idle polling and transient-error backoff.
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//!
//! - define the small handler and outcome contracts used by worker dispatch;
//! - keep a claimed lease alive while a handler is pending;
//! - stop polling the handler when a heartbeat loses ownership;
//! - bind success, deferral, retry, and permanent failure to the current
//!   fencing token; and
//! - make idle passes and transaction failures observable to the polling loop;
//! - honor shutdown without abandoning a pass already holding a lease; and
//! - avoid sleeping between successful jobs so a queued backlog drains quickly.
//!
//! Non-responsibilities: deciding retry backoff, selecting browser selectors,
//! fetching WeChat content, rendering RSS, or serving HTTP. The loop only
//! supplies bounded polling and error waits; runtime composition still owns
//! role selection, concurrency across multiple workers, and metrics. A handler
//! must perform acquisition outside its outcome transaction and return a
//! [`JobExecution`] that already contains the chosen retry/defer time.
//!
//! PostgreSQL/high-availability behavior: claim, heartbeat, and fencing are
//! delegated to [`JobService`], so replicas still coordinate through
//! PostgreSQL `SKIP LOCKED` and lease tokens. This first worker boundary
//! commits only the job outcome through the queue transaction. A future
//! synchronization-specific worker must add a two-phase handler boundary so
//! acquisition stays outside the transaction while article, source, sync,
//! cache, and job writes commit together in `UnitOfWork`. If a heartbeat fails,
//! the handler future is cancelled and no stale outcome is attempted.
//!
//! RSS-cache interaction: this module does not render, read, or publish feeds.
//! Feed rebuild and source-sync handlers remain future work until the worker
//! has a two-phase `UnitOfWork` persistence contract; queue-only completion
//! must not be used to publish business data separately from the job outcome.
