//! Browser-session capacity and ownership policy.
//!
//! This module owns the process-local browser capacity limit and the durable
//! account-lease capability required by authenticated work. It exposes two
//! non-interchangeable session types through [`super::webdriver`]: a clean
//! public session for article pages and an authenticated session tied to one
//! fenced WeRead account lease.
//!
//! Public sessions are obtained from a Tokio semaphore and carry no account
//! identity, credentials, cookies, or lease guard. Authenticated sessions are
//! obtained only after an [`AccountLeaseGuard`] is acquired. A failed heartbeat
//! marks that guard unusable, so the authenticated adapter can stop before its
//! next upstream request. The guard is intentionally non-cloneable; callers
//! must explicitly release it when work finishes.
//!
//! High availability: the semaphore limits only one process. PostgreSQL job
//! leases prevent duplicate source work, while the repository-backed account
//! lease serializes authenticated use of one account across replicas. The
//! browser pool is not a distributed lock and must not replace either durable
//! lease.
//!
//! Non-responsibilities: WebDriver commands, navigation, article parsing,
//! source scheduling, credential persistence, or RSS caching. Browser-side
//! health checks and fresh-profile lifecycle remain TODOs in
//! [`super::webdriver`]; browser-visible timezone validation belongs to that
//! adapter, while pacing and scroll orchestration belong to [`super::pacing`]
//! and [`super::article_page`].
